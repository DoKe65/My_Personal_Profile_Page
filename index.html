        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I love the possibility that the web gives us to create something beautiful without much investments nessesary - all we need is time, perseverance, ideas and motivation. I'm a mother of a grown child and was interested in computers since my brother bought his first one, that's about forty years ago. </p>
        <p>I worked in my brothers company and sold Atari-Computers - It was exciting! At this time, the internet wasn't anything I knew about and I only whishd to learn more about programming and databases - but life had other plans. Now, that I'm already 53 and my daughter is "out of the house" I discovered the endless possibilities to dive in and finaly learn to code!</p>
        <p>I began this exciting journey some years ago with Treehouse, took some courses elsewhere but landed always back here. Now I want to really make something out of it and finaly staying on the track and try to retain what I learned!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>and as much as I can!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm working for an editor of educational books, which teaches mainly the handling of office apllications like MS Word, Excel etc. I am responsible for layout corrections, customerservice, producing and shipping the books and I love my job. But I’d like to move forward and to be able to help my employer maintaine and improve his unfortunately outdated web-presence and online-shop. </p>
        <p>In addition I'd love - perhaps in a few years - to get the possibility to work on some projects for others on a freelance basis.</p>
