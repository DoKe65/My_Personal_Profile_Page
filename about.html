        <h2>I love...</h2>
        <p>My family. They bring action to my life and keep my emotions running! I have a husband - we're not married, but together since almost thirty years, so I see him as my husband. We have a 26 year old daugther together. She lives with her boyfriend. But when she needs somebody, we're always the ancor and she's ours.</p>
        <img src="images/dogwalk.jpg" alt="Playing dogs" class="card-image">
        <p>Our dogs. They keep me sain and - almost - fit. Mailo, our Golden Retriever, is eleven years old, and he isn't the fastest anymore. He doesn't like to be alone anymore and begins to bark after a while. Our other dog is a six years old German Sheppard named Kira. At home she's like a toy - you can do about anything with her, she's always happy and shows it. Outside she's the fierce gard-dog and barks at all the other dogs.</p>
